All trees are acyclic connected graphs.
A stack enforces last in first out.
Your turn,now!

Run the most frequently occurring task first.The reason for that is because then if you run the most frequently occurring  tasks first we have the best chance of not running into the situation where the CPU has to be idle. So ideally the CPU will be idle as little as possible.if we run the most frequently occurring tasks first we have the best chance of it running again in the shortest time period because we can put all the other tasks between it.

First of all understand how we are going to solve this problem.We can actually divide the problem into four  parts.the first part being going right then going down then going towards the left and then finally going up.All we need to make sure is that once we have printed a row or a column we we do not print it again.we actually print the row or column below or  to the left or the right of it.your row index is constant but your column index changes.your row index changes because you are printing the same elements of the column.Because I am visiting every element only once.I’m not taking any extra space I’m only visiting every element.

we want to know which node is the successor of a given node in a bst.

The first thing that comes to mind is that I would iterate through this entire array.
I just want to iterate through this array once I don’t want to go back.

If you don’t mind Let me try and transform this logic into actual code.

Whenever I do DP I care about subproblems, remembering the answers to subproblems and things like that.

We cut off the last character.

The first thing that popped up in my mind about solving this problem.

We conclude the brute force attach would work with small triangles but for big ones it just out of the question.

For any given problem you should try out all possible solutions and pick up desired solutions.

Backtracking is used when you have multiple solutions and you want all those solutions.

In a min heap the elements are all smaller than their children so the root node will be the very smallest element and then looking down the tree the elements get bigger and bigger.

K’th Largest Element in BST:
The idea is to do reverse inorder traversal of BST. The reverse inorder traversal traverses all nodes in decreasing order. While doing the traversal, we keep track of  count of nodes visited so far. When the count becomes equal to k, we stop the traversal and print the key.

Our eviction policy is using the least recently used. What is LRU item?
We need? Fast lookups. Fast Removals.
Fast lookups? What data structure can help us with that?

Doubly linked list
Singly linked list

If we use the linear structure like an array for this if we remove an item we need to shift all the elements over.
For linked list we don’t need to shift items.

we’re going to use a doubly linked list backed by a hash table.
Whatever we choose a node understand that a hash table is backing that fast lookup if we didn’t have the hash table we would potentially do all o(n) operations to find an item.

(: regular Parentheses
{: curly Parentheses
[: square Parentheses

If you have row number equal to 700 you’re first going to do a mod an 700 that will result in 24 which is equivalent to Y so you have got the unit’s place value which is y.Now what you’re going to do is you are going to divide 700 by 26 which will result in 26.

When we think about recursion we think about base cases and calling ourselves and all of that.
When we think about backtracking we think about choosing exploring and un-choosing.

How do we keep track of our choices?
In an auxiliary string variable.
What data structure the data is coming in?
One way we can do it it is we could go through all years that are potentially possible and look for the years of the highest population.
It shouldn’t impact your run time?

It doesn’t matter which technology are working with maybe You’re woking on Java, asp.net.

What actually constitutes an island?
An island is just a bunch of ones that are connected horizontally or vertically.
One represents land and 0 represents   water.

It’s important to note that if the islands are diagonal to each other then that does not mean they are the same island.

A great way to solve this problem is you iterate over your 2d array and every time you encounter a  one you increase your island count. So we’re going to be iterating from left to right from row to row.Once we get to the end down here we should have the total count of islands.

When we encounter a one we immediately need to increase our island count. We don’t want to increase our island count if they’re connected horizontally or vertically because then we’re going to output the wrong number.

The best way to solve this problem is to use a recursive function to actually change these ones right here to zeros change them to water.

We do two things when we encounter a one.
1) Increate our island count.
2) Change any other land connected to zeros.

It’s saying if we go out of bounds if we’re trying to check a position that’s out of bounds of your our grid then we don’t even want to continue in this function we want just return immediately out of this recursive call.

left direction right direction upwards direction downwards direction.

Every time we encounter a character one in our grid.

Call a recursive function to change all ones that are connected to zeros.Because we don’t want to increase our island count multiple times for the same island.

Linear scan the 2d grid map, if a node contains a '1', then it is a root node that triggers a Depth First Search. During DFS, every visited node should be set as '0' to mark as visited node. Count the number of root nodes that trigger DFS, this number would be the number of islands since each DFS starting at some root identifies an island.

Do some quick error checking.
The element before the strictly decreasing section is the element that still has options to explore.

Any problem that asks you to generate a bunch of different combinations can often be boiled down to a backtracking problem.

In our recursive calls we’re gonna need a base case and in other words we’re gonna need a place to know when to stop. so we want to stop this recursive function when we have a correct combination.

No leading zeros in each section.

1)Our Choice
What choice do we make at each call of the function?
Recursion expresses decision.
2) Our Constraints.
When do we stop following a certain parth?
When do we not even to one way?
3) Our goal.
What’s our target?
What are we trying to find?

Make a choice explore undo our choice.
Choose explore un choose This is a very common pattern in backtracking.

Big O is not about a certain value it’s about a behavior of a graph as input scales.

No two queens are under attack.

The client is going to touch base with us next week about the project specs.
Do you think we can touch base on the status of our visa next week?
Are you free for a call on Monday?
I need a money order for five hundred bucks.

HashCode’s are used in Hashing to decide which group(or bucket) an object should be placed into.

A method having the same name as another method but having different parameters is called an overloaded method.

Creating a Sub Class with same signature as that of a method in SuperClass is called Method overriding.

What is an Interface?
An interface defines a contract for responsibilities (methods) of class.

Both abstract  class and interface is used to achieve the abstraction.Abstraction is one of the important concept of OOP and it is available in most of the programming languages.

Abstract method means only prototype only method declaration no method body.

Hide implementation logic and implementation logic will be defined by the respective child class.
Abstraction means hiding the implementation logic.

20% feature you want to hide in that case you can use abstract classes but the full hundred percent feature you want to hide or implementation you want to hide and the respective child classes should do that in that case you have to use interfaces.

Polymorphism is defined as “Same Code” giving “Different Behavior”.

An index makes reading faster and improves query performance.
Slow queries are one the most common causes of poor performance.

An index is an ordered representation of the indexed data.
Searching in an ordered data is a lot more efficient than searching in an unordered data.

B-Tree.it is a balanced tree. the leaf nodes will always be at the same level. The leaf nodes also form what’s called a doubly linked list.If we don’t have a doubly linked list we would have to go back up the tree find the next leaf node.By having the doubly linked list we can scan through them sequentially without having to go back up the tree every time.

An index only contains the values of the columns you actually put the index on.

Indexing make reading faster but writing slower.
we want have as many indices as necessary but as few as possible.
