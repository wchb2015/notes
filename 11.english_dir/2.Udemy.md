Now, we’re not limited to just putting a number like that, we can actually put a mathematical expression there.
Now these mathematical processes can get quite complex.
2*10: two times ten.

What will happen if I do this.

I’ve surrounded it in double-quotes(‘’).
And the hint there is that it changed to ‘green’
This a not a variable.this is actually a string.We want you to print whatever is in there and not to try and decipher that as a variable but print it out as it was.

MyFirstNumber is assigned the value of 6.
Third number which is 6.

I’m just going to copy and paste that.

And this a another good thing that ’IntelliJ’ will come up and tell you is if you  see a variable that’s grayed out like that, and you just hover your mouse over it. It actually gives you a hint and says well if myTotal is never used.

Set up this variable but it hasn’t been used anywhere.

Java is case sensitive

Define a new variable that had a difference between 1000 and the current value of ‘myTotal’?

Pause the video here and then comeback when you are ready and we’ll have a look at the solution.
So how did it go? Did you figure it out?
1000-myTotal        'look at the number 1000 deduct it from myTotal'

The difference between a 1000 and 117 is 883 if my math is correct.

Now I actually made a typo there.

That’s very much a common source of problems when you’re learning a new language is to get the syntax wrong.

```
Classes,Objects,Inheritance,Polymorphism,Encapsulation.

A class is simply a blueprint.
So a class  would be an instruction manual by itself.
It doesn’t do anything inherently useful but once you instantiate that class once you use it to create something you’ll come up with an object at the end.

A class is simply a blueprint that can create an object.
A class can also have things inside it called methods that allow the object to do things.
And also in the class we have what are called properties.

Now the other difference between a class and an object is that on the whole A class does not change and there is only ever one class for an object.

But that’s an advanced topic and we will cover that later on.

So in the next lecture we’re going to go head and create a class and instantiate an Object which is the official terminology for building an object.

I’m going to set you a little homework.

I want you to practice instantiating an object from that class.
I would like you to instantiate with color red and manufacturer.
I’d like you to make a new saloon car class that inherits from Car class.
I hope you’ve learned something worthwhile.
I do recommend that you start this course in order.

And then inside the saloon car class putting in a new property.
And I haven’t mentioned encapsulation which is the last topic we covered.

But that’s kind of implicitly covered.

Whenever we create objects inside our constructor we don’t necessarily know what our class constructor is doing.
So we have covered encapsulation in that way.

So if you’ve enjoyed this course please leave me a a good review.If you haven’t please leave me a decent review and tell me what you didn’t enjoy about it.

in line with 符合.
And in the future I will make the course more in line with what people might expect.

It’s vitally important that the the person who teaches you programming is passionate about doing so.
Industry best practices.

bear with me 忍受我.
Choose the highest available via the gear icon.
The higher the number the better the quality.

In the bottom right-hand corner of the screen

Do note that depending on your internet speed the 1080P may not be available.

If you want to change the speed of the video when its playing you do this by hovering on the 1x icon and choosing the speed you want.

Type in a keyword or different words you’re looking for
Udemy will display a list of all the lectures in these course that have those words in the title.

You can also search for Questions and Answers by going to the Q&A tab.
bearing in mind that

It’s going to prompt you to drag and drop an image or click it on the choose file button once you do that you can add the image to your questions.

Format the code and also nicely color codes as well so this could be a really good way to show the code that you’re working on.

Other students chime in and answer it.

One other thing I recommend you is when your question has been solved by either myself or another student or even yourself for that matter.it’s a great idea to mark it as solved.

64-bit version of Windows.

JRE stands for java Runtime Edition

Nothing more, nothing less.

Depending on the edition of IntelliJ that

“Ultimate Edition”,This is the paid version of “IntelliJ”

Give you a lot more options.

refer back to

Finish off the set up of the ‘Project SDK’

‘Project name ’ is self-explanatory.

I don’t actually recommend you type ’spaces’

For a project name, you want to type in whatever it is.But don’t put any spaces in there.

I want to navigate to a new folder.

click on ‘new folder’ type in ‘Java Programs’

‘src’ which is the abbreviation for ‘source’

So I’m going to right-click that now.

Huge menu of options

At the end of the first line. I’m putting spaces between them.

An uppercase ‘P’.In this case, it’s highlighted in ‘red’ which is saying ‘there’s an error’

So do make sure you check your code carefully.

IDEA will normally tell you what  the problem is.

So let’s finish off our first program.

Then a  regular ‘bracket’[parenthesis]

The word ‘String’ with a capital ’S’ I’m going to put a brace({) now.

Double quote.
exclamation marks感叹号.

get rid of
A whole number without any decimal points.
We need to define what is called the ‘data type’.Then we need to assign a name to it.And optionally, we need to also define a ‘value’ to it.
Int all in lowercase. I’m going to call it myFirstNumber. Equals = . A semi-colon(;)semicolon
a punctuation mark.标点符号.
