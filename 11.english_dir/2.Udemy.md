1. Whole number is not retaining any remainders.
2. So a double takes up twice the amount of memory than a float does.
3. And that in a nutshell is the float and the double.for dealing with single and double precision numbers in Java.
4. And just one last thing now just to finish off.Use underscores when defining a literal value.
5. Byte, short, int, long float, double, char, boolean, primitive types in Java.Byte-short-int-long and so on and so forth.Create your own data types also known as ‘objects’.
6. String is a sequence of characters.By using plus operator.We are dealing with textual data only.That’s the multiplication.result++;So the ‘++’ is saying  ‘increment the count result by one’
7. Depending on whether a value is ‘true’ or ‘false’
8. ==false.It’s testing to see whether the particular value is false.
9. And suddenly, we’ve got no  output.Because that value in the brackets has evaluated has been returned as false.
10. The next line of code isn’t executed.
11. Operator precedence.Make your code more clear and unambiguous.
12. Or operator only one of the conditions need to be true.ternary operator.
13. Nuts and bolts
14.
```
Summary of Operators

java operator precedence table:

```
15. Compare your results to mine.Expressions, statements, code blocks and methods.So, let’s make a start.
16. elaborate a little bit on expressions.
17. Now, Java has actually got 50 reserved words that are used for keywords in your applications.
18. A mile is equal to 1.6 kilometers.score=0 is also a valid expression as well.
19. a  statement is the entire line.So when in doubt, go up to the code menu, select Reformat code.Or you can use the appropriate  shortcut, which on a Mac you can see is CMD+Option+L.But that will be different obviously for a Windows or a linux platform.
20. So that’s statements, white space , and indentation.

Install the right version of the JDK.
Oracle now releasing new versions of Java every six months, instead of a new version once every 2-3 years.

Java9 will actually be retired in March 2018.
Note that irrespective of what version  you download and use, you can follow along and get the maximum value from the course.

We’ll just let that finish off.
A series of plugins on the screen
Some of the advanced things can only work with the ultimate product.

Specifically we’re going to install it on ubuntu 16.04
do something similar for your distro.
“/” forward slash
“- -” two dashes

I would successfully installed Java.
‘src’ is an abbreviation for ‘source’.
When you create a new class in IntelliJ, it creates a file and it ends in .java.
So all java files that you’re creating end in ‘.java’

And looking at the sizes , you notice that ‘Hello.class’ is larger than the ‘Hello.java’.

looks a little bit like Mumbo-jumbo.
It certainly hasn’t got the same code.

The other thing I want to point out, is that IntelliJ product is automatically saving things for you.
It’s rare that you’ll ever need too.

Generally speaking, “IntelliJ” is handling the saving of this behind the scenes.

Click on this little ‘cog’. (齿轮)

Once you do that, you’ve got a free-standing window that you can move anywhere on the screen.

Manipulate “IntelliJ IDEA” and to create a custom layout that suits your machine.

So, let’s make a start on that right now.
called the int which is short for integer.

Click on the Red Cross in the left(关闭) hand corner of the screen.

Int myValue=1000;
Create a variable called myValue of type ‘integer’ with a value 10000.
So in computing terms the computer has allocated enough space to store an integer and it’s assigned a name for that variable of ‘myValue’.

If we hover our mouse.

The maximum value is , by getting rid of the minus sign at the front, that’s the maximum number.

You can put underscores(_) in there to make the number more readable.
Now this has been a feature that has come out since Java7.

So if you’re typing in a literal , you can use underscores.

So if we try and exceed that, we get an error.(-128-127)


It can be far more efficient to use a byte because the computer is not allocating as much as space for a byte than it is for an integer.

Int has a width of 32.

Now technically that’s wrong(long  myLongValue=100).

just as a recap.只是一个回顾.

the forward slash is ‘divided by’.

No problems there.

Byte myByteValue=-128;
byte b2 = b1 / 2;
Whereas the one above is a literal, because it’s actually just a fixed number.

An integer takes up a lot more space than a byte, so that number physically won’t fit into the area of memory that has been assigned.

This is just a weird thing that Java does and what you need to do to get around that is you need to specifically say to java ,look,I want you to treat this as a byte.

Java by default if you don’t specify the type that you actually want, it converts it to an integer automatically

I’m now going to issue a challenge to you.

Now that I’ve deleted that off the screen.

Lastly, create a variable of type long and make it equal to 50000.
```

```
Now, we’re not limited to just putting a number like that, we can actually put a mathematical expression there.
Now these mathematical processes can get quite complex.
2*10: two times ten.

What will happen if I do this.

I’ve surrounded it in double-quotes(‘’).
And the hint there is that it changed to ‘green’
This a not a variable.this is actually a string.We want you to print whatever is in there and not to try and decipher that as a variable but print it out as it was.

MyFirstNumber is assigned the value of 6.
Third number which is 6.

I’m just going to copy and paste that.

And this a another good thing that ’IntelliJ’ will come up and tell you is if you  see a variable that’s grayed out like that, and you just hover your mouse over it. It actually gives you a hint and says well if myTotal is never used.

Set up this variable but it hasn’t been used anywhere.

Java is case sensitive

Define a new variable that had a difference between 1000 and the current value of ‘myTotal’?

Pause the video here and then comeback when you are ready and we’ll have a look at the solution.
So how did it go? Did you figure it out?
1000-myTotal        'look at the number 1000 deduct it from myTotal'

The difference between a 1000 and 117 is 883 if my math is correct.

Now I actually made a typo there.

That’s very much a common source of problems when you’re learning a new language is to get the syntax wrong.

Solid arrows
Dotted arrows
I’ll just comment that out with the two backslashes(\\) as we’ve seen before.

result=result-1 “ result equals result take (minus) 1”
result=result * 10 “ result equals result times by 10”
result=result / 10 “ result equals result divided by 10”
That’d be the multiplication sign(*) there.
Forward slash(/) is ‘divided by’

This one’s called the ‘remainder’(%) operator.
So what we want to do with the operation is we want to return what the ‘remainder’ is using two operands

Result = result % 3.
Give me the remainder of result divided by 3.

But we won’t be doing that right now.

But what we can do is be all inclusive with yet another operator
And put greater than equal (>=) to 100.
Less than equal <=
topScore is set to 100.

So that’s using the ampersand(&)
```

```
Classes,Objects,Inheritance,Polymorphism,Encapsulation.

A class is simply a blueprint.
So a class  would be an instruction manual by itself.
It doesn’t do anything inherently useful but once you instantiate that class once you use it to create something you’ll come up with an object at the end.

A class is simply a blueprint that can create an object.
A class can also have things inside it called methods that allow the object to do things.
And also in the class we have what are called properties.

Now the other difference between a class and an object is that on the whole A class does not change and there is only ever one class for an object.

But that’s an advanced topic and we will cover that later on.

So in the next lecture we’re going to go head and create a class and instantiate an Object which is the official terminology for building an object.

I’m going to set you a little homework.

I want you to practice instantiating an object from that class.
I would like you to instantiate with color red and manufacturer.
I’d like you to make a new saloon car class that inherits from Car class.
I hope you’ve learned something worthwhile.
I do recommend that you start this course in order.

And then inside the saloon car class putting in a new property.
And I haven’t mentioned encapsulation which is the last topic we covered.

But that’s kind of implicitly covered.

Whenever we create objects inside our constructor we don’t necessarily know what our class constructor is doing.
So we have covered encapsulation in that way.

So if you’ve enjoyed this course please leave me a a good review.If you haven’t please leave me a decent review and tell me what you didn’t enjoy about it.

in line with 符合.
And in the future I will make the course more in line with what people might expect.

It’s vitally important that the the person who teaches you programming is passionate about doing so.
Industry best practices.

bear with me 忍受我.
Choose the highest available via the gear icon.
The higher the number the better the quality.

In the bottom right-hand corner of the screen

Do note that depending on your internet speed the 1080P may not be available.

If you want to change the speed of the video when its playing you do this by hovering on the 1x icon and choosing the speed you want.

Type in a keyword or different words you’re looking for
Udemy will display a list of all the lectures in these course that have those words in the title.

You can also search for Questions and Answers by going to the Q&A tab.
bearing in mind that

It’s going to prompt you to drag and drop an image or click it on the choose file button once you do that you can add the image to your questions.

Format the code and also nicely color codes as well so this could be a really good way to show the code that you’re working on.

Other students chime in and answer it.

One other thing I recommend you is when your question has been solved by either myself or another student or even yourself for that matter.it’s a great idea to mark it as solved.

64-bit version of Windows.

JRE stands for java Runtime Edition

Nothing more, nothing less.

Depending on the edition of IntelliJ that

“Ultimate Edition”,This is the paid version of “IntelliJ”

Give you a lot more options.

refer back to

Finish off the set up of the ‘Project SDK’

‘Project name ’ is self-explanatory.

I don’t actually recommend you type ’spaces’

For a project name, you want to type in whatever it is.But don’t put any spaces in there.

I want to navigate to a new folder.

click on ‘new folder’ type in ‘Java Programs’

‘src’ which is the abbreviation for ‘source’

So I’m going to right-click that now.

Huge menu of options

At the end of the first line. I’m putting spaces between them.

An uppercase ‘P’.In this case, it’s highlighted in ‘red’ which is saying ‘there’s an error’

So do make sure you check your code carefully.

IDEA will normally tell you what  the problem is.

So let’s finish off our first program.

Then a  regular ‘bracket’[parenthesis]

The word ‘String’ with a capital ’S’ I’m going to put a brace({) now.

Double quote.
exclamation marks感叹号.

get rid of
A whole number without any decimal points.
We need to define what is called the ‘data type’.Then we need to assign a name to it.And optionally, we need to also define a ‘value’ to it.
Int all in lowercase. I’m going to call it myFirstNumber. Equals = . A semi-colon(;)semicolon
a punctuation mark.标点符号.
