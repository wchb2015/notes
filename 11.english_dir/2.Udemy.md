A class is simply a blueprint.
So a class  would be an instruction manual by itself.
It doesn’t do anything inherently useful but once you instantiate that class once you use it to create something you’ll come up with an object at the end.

A class is simply a blueprint that can create an object.
A class can also have things inside it called methods that allow the object to do things.
And also in the class we have what are called properties.

Now the other difference between a class and an object is that on the whole
A class does not change and there is only ever one class for an object.

But that’s an advanced topic and we will cover that later on.

So in the next lecture we’re going to go head and create a class and instantiate an
Object which is the official terminology for building an object.

I’m going to set you a little homework.
Classes,Objects,Inheritance,Polymorphism,Encapsulation.
I want you to practice instantiating an object from that class.
I would like you to instantiate with color red and manufacturer.
I’d like you to make a new saloon car class that inherits from Car class.
And then inside the saloon car class putting in a new property.
And I haven’t mentioned encapsulation which is the last topic we covered.
But that’s kind of implicitly covered.
Whenever we create objects inside our constructor we don’t necessarily know what our class constructor is doing.
So we have covered encapsulation in that way.

So if you’ve enjoyed this course please leave me a a good review.
If you haven’t please leave me a decent review and tell me what you didn’t enjoy about it.

in line with 符合.
And in the future I will make the course more in line with what people might expect.
I hope you’ve learned something worthwhile.

It’s vitally important that the the person who
Teaches you programming is passionate about
Doing so.
Industry best practices.
bear with me 忍受我.
Choose the highest available via via the gear icon.
The higher the number the better the quality.
In the bottom right-hand corner of the screen
Do note that depending on your internet speed the 1080P may not be available.
If you want to change the speed of the video when its playing you do this by hovering on the 1x icon and choosing the speed you want.
I do recommend that you start this course in order.
Type in a keyword or different words you’re looking for
Udemy will display a list of all the lectures in these course that have those words in the title.
You can also search for Questions and Answers by going to the Q&A tab.
bearing in mind that
It’s going to prompt you to drag and drop an image or click it on the choose file button once you do that you can add the image to your questions.
Format the code and also nicely color codes as well so this could be a really good way to show the code that you’re working on.

Other students chime in and answer it.
One other thing I recommend you is when your question has been solved by either myself or another student or even yourself for that matter.it’s a great idea to mark it as solved.
64-bit version of Windows.
JRE stands for java Runtime Edition
Nothing more, nothing less.
Depending on the edition of IntelliJ that
“Ultimate Edition”,This is the paid version of “IntelliJ”
Give you a lot more options.
refer back to
Finish off the set up of the ‘Project SDK’
‘Project name ’ is self-explanatory.
I don’t actually recommend you type ’spaces’
For a project name, you want to type in whatever it is.But don’t put any spaces in there.
I want to navigate to a new folder.
click on ‘new folder’ type in ‘Java Programs’
‘src’ which is the abbreviation for ‘source’
So I’m going to right-click that now.
Huge menu of options
At the end of the first line. I’m putting spaces between them.
An uppercase ‘P’.In this case, it’s highlighted  in ‘red’ which is saying ‘there’s an error’
So do make sure you check your code carefully.
IDEA will normally tell you what  the problem is.
So let’s finish off our first program.
Then a  regular ‘bracket’[parenthesis]
The word ‘String’ with a capital ’S’
I’m going to put a brace({) now.
Double quote.
exclamation marks感叹号.
substitute the word ‘tim’ for ‘your name’
get rid of
A whole number without any decimal points.
We need to define what is called the ‘data type’.Then we need to assign a  name to it.And optionally, we need to also define a ‘value’ to it.
Int all in lowercase. I’m going to call it myFirstNumber. Equals = . A semi-colon(;)
a punctuation mark.标点符号.
