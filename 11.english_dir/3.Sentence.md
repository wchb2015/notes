11. The advantage of messaging is that it increases loose coupling and scalability.
12. Notice that if a vertex has no incoming edges, it can go first.

14. The stack tracks ordering.
15. V1 ∩ V2 = {} V1 U V2 = V
- The intersection has to be empty.
- There’s no common elements.
- The two sets V1 and V2 are disjoint.
- If we take the union of the two subsets, we get that original set V back.
- This is going to create a contradiction.

21. And the smaller the company, the more hats you have to wear.
22. The idea is that we need to swap the left and right child of all nodes in the tree. So we create a queue to store nodes whose left and right child have not been swapped yet.
23. The time complexity depends on how many nodes the recursion tree has.
24. We are going to maintain a hash map where we track the number of unique characters as we go along the input string and the hash map will contain the character and the corresponding count to the character in the substring that we are looking at.
26. This approach generally works in all cases except in the case where the notes that are getting swapped from original binary search tree are placed adjacent to each other in the inorder traversal.

1. It is a heck of a lot of simpler.
2. So, why JavaScript and not something else? So,without further ado, let's dive right in.Get your hands dirty with some coding.HTML is responsible for holding the content of a web page,and css is responsible for styling this content and handling the layout.Css is for presentation.Now JS is the programming language that allows us add dynamics into the picture like dynamic effects, manipulation of the content or css and much more.
3. It’s better to keep the website content and the Javascript logic in separate places.Primitive just means that these are not objects.So, to make it simple, Boolean is either true or false.
4. Undefined: Data type of variable which does not have a value yet.Null, also means ‘non-existent’.Why does JS transform our number to a String?And this is something called type coercion.We do it very usually.
5. Changing the value of a variable is called variable mutation.
6. precedents of operators.How do we now retrieve an element out of this object? (Js).To read a value out of an object, there are two main ways.The first one is to use the dot notation.The second way is to use square brackets such as we did with the arrays.
7. We barely scratched the surface here, but it’s already a great amount of material here.Put it simply, break is to break out of the loop, so to finish the loop at a certain point, and continue is to quit the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next one.
8. ternary operator. 三元运算符.

9. Now that we have our options configuration in place we can go ahead.
10. And this is the kind of information that’s really important to track down.We can use the status text value to determine whether or not the request was successful.We have both of our errors handled.This is not exactly reusable and it really doesn’t belong here.

- It’s a little more cross OS friendly.So use the following script for cross OS compatibility.
- The version 1.0 is not backwards compatible with the version used here.
14. I’d recommend reading this book or checking out a course.
- This return statement isn’t doing anything fancy.All we’re doing is using it to prevent the rest of the function from executing.
15. We get everything in the todo array regardless of whether or not it has certain values.
- In order to query based on certain values.I’m going to shut down the script by running the control c.
16. We’re going to make that .gitignore in the root of our project.If you remember, this lets you specify files and folders that you want to leave out of your version control.
17. We will be using delete one which targets one document and removes it.Currently there are three out of five that fit that criteria.
20. Postman lets you create HTTP requests and fire them off.

1. Whole number is not retaining any remainders.
2. So a double takes up twice the amount of memory than a float does.
3. And that in a nutshell is the float and the double.for dealing with single and double precision numbers in Java.
4. And just one last thing now just to finish off.Use underscores when defining a literal value.
5. Byte, short, int, long float, double, char, boolean, primitive types in Java.Byte-short-int-long and so on and so forth.Create your own data types also known as ‘objects’.
6. String is a sequence of characters.By using plus operator.We are dealing with textual data only.That’s the multiplication.result++;So the ‘++’ is saying  ‘increment the count result by one’
7. Depending on whether a value is ‘true’ or ‘false’
8. ==false.It’s testing to see whether the particular value is false.

1. On a Mac I can hold down cmd+/.
2. Cmd+/ is the keyboard shortcut on a Mac.
3. Accessibility of variables.
4. The first  approach would be to create a complete new set of variables.The disadvantage with that approach is you’re using excess memory so you’re creating new variables that you don’t potentially need.
5. The advantage with that approach is it was quicker, we didn’t create new variables.
6. And the disadvantage with copying and pasting code is we’re duplicating code.
7. So that’s a handy way to know if you’ve got any methods that aren’t being used in your programs.Check to see whether they’re light gray in IntelliJ.
8. So, Let’s continue on with methods.Method overloading is very commonly used in Java.
9. Assign a variable to a method result.So it’s time for a challenge.
10. So what I want to do is just correct what was actually a flaw in the code that I’ve developed for this lecture.
11. There’s a logic hold in your challenge code and he’s actually quite correct.So there’s actually a bug in the code .So what should happen in theory.
12. It actually bypasses all of these and just goes down to the final else and returns ‘4’.
13. Fix all our logic problems.
14. slipped to position 4.
15. So thanks to A and B for pointing that out. 谢谢指出错误.
16. So keep that in mind, that is actually a really important thing to make sure when you testing your ranges, that you include everything.
17. It is the option where you use the same method name but with different parameters.
18. You can’t use an identical method with an identical number of parameters that is the problem there.
19. We got an error now in line 17 because we’re trying to access variable the parameter that no longer exists in this particular method.
20. We get rid of the parameters. (不要参数)
21. sort of outside that range in other words you want to return negative 1 (-1)for both of those scenarios.

```
25. Compare your results to mine.Expressions, statements, code blocks and methods.So, let’s make a start.
26. elaborate a little bit on expressions.
27. Now, Java has actually got 50 reserved words that are used for keywords in your applications.
28. A mile is equal to 1.6 kilometers.score=0 is also a valid expression as well.
29. a  statement is the entire line.So when in doubt, go up to the code menu, select Reformat code.Or you can use the appropriate  shortcut, which on a Mac you can see is CMD+Option+L.But that will be different obviously for a Windows or a linux platform.
30. So that’s statements, white space , and indentation.

1. Install the right version of the JDK.
2. Oracle now releasing new versions of Java every six months, instead of a new version once every 2-3 years.
3. Java9 will actually be retired in March 2018.Note that irrespective of what version  you download and use, you can follow along and get the maximum value from the course.
4. We’ll just let that finish off.A series of plugins on the screen
5. Some of the advanced things can only work with the ultimate product.
6. Specifically we’re going to install it on ubuntu 16.04
7. do something similar for your distro.(发行版)“/” forward slash.“- -” two dashes
8. I would successfully installed Java.
9. ‘src’ is an abbreviation for ‘source’.
10. When you create a new class in IntelliJ, it creates a file and it ends in .java.
11. So all java files that you’re creating end in ‘.java’
12. And looking at the sizes , you notice that ‘Hello.class’ is larger than the ‘Hello.java’.
13. looks a little bit like Mumbo-jumbo.
14. It certainly hasn’t got the same code.
15. The other thing I want to point out, is that IntelliJ product is automatically saving things for you.
16. It’s rare that you’ll ever need too.
17. Generally speaking, “IntelliJ” is handling the saving of this behind the scenes.
18. Click on this little ‘cog’. (齿轮)
19. Once you do that, you’ve got a free-standing window that you can move anywhere on the screen.
20. Manipulate “IntelliJ IDEA” and to create a custom layout that suits your machine.
21. So, let’s make a start on that right now.called the int which is short for integer.
22. Click on the Red Cross in the left(关闭) hand corner of the screen.
23. Int myValue=1000;Create a variable called myValue of type ‘integer’ with a value 10000.
24. So in computing terms the computer has allocated enough space to store an integer and it’s assigned a name for that variable of ‘myValue’.
25. If we hover our mouse.The maximum value is , by getting rid of the minus sign at the front, that’s the maximum number.
26. You can put underscores(_) in there to make the number more readable.
27. Now this has been a feature that has come out since Java7.
28. So if you’re typing in a literal , you can use underscores.
29. So if we try and exceed that, we get an error.(-128-127)
30. It can be far more efficient to use a byte because the computer is not allocating as much as space for a byte than it is for an integer.

### 第14组
1. Int has a width of 32.
2. Now technically that’s wrong(long  myLongValue=100).
3. just as a recap.只是一个回顾.
4. the forward slash is ‘divided by’.No problems there.
5. Byte myByteValue=-128;byte b2 = b1 / 2;
6. Whereas the one above is a literal, because it’s actually just a fixed number.
7. An integer takes up a lot more space than a byte, so that number physically won’t fit into the area of memory that has been assigned.
8. This is just a weird thing that Java does and what you need to do to get around that is you need to specifically say to java ,look,I want you to treat this as a byte.
9. Java by default if you don’t specify the type that you actually want, it converts it to an integer automatically.
10. I’m now going to issue a challenge to you.
11. Now that I’ve deleted that off the screen.
12. Lastly, create a variable of type long and make it equal to 50000.
13. Now, we’re not limited to just putting a number like that, we can actually put a mathematical expression there.
14. Now these mathematical processes can get quite complex.2*10: two times ten.
15. What will happen if I do this.I’ve surrounded it in double-quotes(‘’).
16. And the hint there is that it changed to ‘green’
17. This is not a variable.this is actually a string.We want you to print whatever is in there and not to try and decipher that as a variable but print it out as it was.
18. MyFirstNumber is assigned the value of 6.Third number which is 6.
19. I’m just going to copy and paste that.
20. And this a another good thing that ’IntelliJ’ will come up and tell you is if you  see a variable that’s grayed out like that, and you just hover your mouse over it. It actually gives you a hint and says well if myTotal is never used.
21. Set up this variable but it hasn’t been used anywhere.
22. Java is case sensitive
23. Define a new variable that had a difference between 1000 and the current value of ‘myTotal’?
24. 1000-myTotal        'look at the number 1000 deduct it from myTotal'
25. The difference between a 1000 and 117 is 883 if my math is correct.
26. That’s very much a common source of problems when you’re learning a new language is to get the syntax wrong.
27. I’ll just comment that out with the two backslashes(\\) as we’ve seen before.
28.
```
result=result-1 “ result equals result take (minus) 1”
result=result * 10 “ result equals result times by 10”
result=result / 10 “ result equals result divided by 10”
That’d be the multiplication sign(*) there.
Forward slash(/) is ‘divided by’

This one’s called the ‘remainder’(%) operator.
So what we want to do with the operation is we want to return what the ‘remainder’ is using two operands

Result = result % 3.
Give me the remainder of result divided by 3.
```
29. But we won’t be doing that right now.But what we can do is be all inclusive with yet another operator
And put greater than equal (>=) to 100.
30. Less than equal <=.topScore is set to 100.

1. So that’s using the ampersand(&)
2. Classes,Objects,Inheritance,Polymorphism,Encapsulation.
3. A class is simply a blueprint.So a class  would be an instruction manual by itself.
4. It doesn’t do anything inherently useful but once you instantiate that class once you use it to create something you’ll come up with an object at the end.
5. A class is simply a blueprint that can create an object.
6. A class can also have things inside it called methods that allow the object to do things.
