## 定语从句
1. 定语从句是从句充当定语的功能,类似于形容词,也叫形容词性从句,定语从句修饰的名词称为"先行词".

#### 第一种:以关系代词"who,that,whom,which"引导.
1. 特点①从句还原,先行词带入从句中,可以使从句完整. ②去掉从句后,主句是独立的句子.
```
例:Students who have musical talents can attend musical training.
先行词:students.
从句:who have musical talents.
从句还原:students have musical talents.
主句:Students can attend musical training.
```
2. 关系代词的选择:

||充当主语|充当宾语|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|先行词是人|who/that|whom/that(经常可以省略)|
|先行词是物|which/that|which/that(经常可以省略)|

#### 第二种:以关系副词why,where,when引导

#### 定语从句常见错误
1. where,why,when引导的定语从句,从句必须是完整独立的句子.
```
There are many foreign universities which provide good courses for international students.
```
2. 定语从句修饰的名词如果是人,用who/that,如果是物,用which/that.
3. 定语从句的谓语要完整,比如说被动语态要出现be动词.
```
There was an increase in the percentage of people who were employed by large companies.
```
4. 定语从句的先行词放在从句中可以还原成完整的句子.
```
wrong:By taking on part-time jobs,universities students can learn skills which cannot get at university.
right:By taking on part-time jobs,universities students can learn skills which they cannot get at university.
```
5. 非限定性定语从句,如果修饰的是名词,那么和这个名词保持主谓一致.
6. 非限定性定语从句,如果是修饰一个句子,从句的谓语永远用单数.
```
Buying luxuries can cost a lot of money,which affects their living standards.
```
7. 如果先行词在从句中充当主语的定语,那么用whose,而不是which或者who.
```
先行词China做从句主语economy的定语,不能用which.
Of those fast-growing countries,China,whose economy has been growing at 9 percent per year,is particularly successful.
```
8. 关系代词如果是在介词后面,只能用which或者whom不能用that.
There are plenty of natural resources in China,most of which are unused.

9. 定语从句中的动词应该和先行词保持一致.
```
The elderly,who are normally incapable of looking after themselves,need time and compassion from their family.
```
10. 以 that, which, who 引导的定语从句,从句一定缺成分,不是主语就是宾语;以 where, why 引导的定语从句,从句一定完整;“in which, by which, through which”后面也要加完整 的句子

#### 限定性定语从句和非限定性定语从句.
1. 非限定性定语从句(有逗号):起补充说明作用,基本没有修饰关系,翻译为:另外,并且.
2. 限定性定从(无逗号),修饰关系强烈.
```
The boss fired all the workers in the country,who were late.(有逗号,非限)(老板解雇了所有的员工,另外,他们都迟到了)
The boss fired all the workers in the country who were late.(无逗号,限定)(老板解雇了所有迟到的员工)
