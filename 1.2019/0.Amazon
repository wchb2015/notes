Userâ€™s auth token expired and get logged out?
To ensure our customer experience is stellar, we have a company expectation that all system owners provide round the clock support for critical issues.
 if we do not explicitly throw an error, but say zero sent-count, it means we had nowhere to send to
 if the auth token expires, the user has to open the app (DMPS registers endpoints and would refresh auth token on app startup)

Are there any related, prerequisite changes upon which this CM hinges?
However when the transactions start taking longer, it will need to spawn more threads (concurrent connections) to honor the TPS you've asked for:
This allows you to have a potentially heterogeneous fleet where some workers are beefier than others. 
We saw a 3x increase from normal traffic to Q4 peak traffic last year.  Other than a very small blip to RegisterMobileEndpoints on the 19th we didn't see any significant increase from Prime Day.

No. For your convenience, we let your one-click child environment impersonate its parent environment (getting its identity, permissions, secret keys, etc.), provided that all of the following conditions are met:

threshold
During the execution phase, we will start loading at 20% load and will increment with 20% for every twenty mins until we reach 120% of the projected traffic, after a successful 120% load we will come back to 100% load and at 100% load we will execute a AZ Outage scenario.
If this CM is intrusive, what services will be affected?
 I haven't resolved that yet.
 However, many of our customers conduct gamedays where the load steps are non-deterministic.
